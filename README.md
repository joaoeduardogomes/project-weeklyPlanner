# Weekly Planner ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· **ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸**

In this project, you can easily create and manage your weekly goals and download them as a planner.

## What problem does it solve?

When searching for a weekly planner, I faced the dilemma of not wanting to buy a physical one and take up space in my room. Online planners were an option, but they often provided only PDFs for printing. That's when the idea struck me: "Why not code my own planner?" And here it is.

## Project Goal

The primary objective of this project was to develop a functional and aesthetically pleasing weekly planner to help users organize their weekly goals effectively.

## Lessons learned & challenges

Creating the visual template on Canva was straightforward, but translating it into code presented its challenges. 
I grappled with implementing an editable weekday area where users could click to create a `<li>` element. 
Ensuring responsiveness, especially with images, also posed challenges. 
The most formidable hurdle remains the capability to print the page as a PDF, an aspect I'm actively working on.
